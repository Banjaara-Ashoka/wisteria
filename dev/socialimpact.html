    	<h1>(s)Tuck on Sustainability</h1>
    	
    	<p>In this workshop, conducted by Labonie Roy, we will learn how to recycle waste from our very own tuck shop to create useful items. As a socially responsible festival, we aim to pay close attention to our waste generation and reduce it as much as we can. This workshop is an attempt to both highlight the importance of recycling waste as well as make it accessible and fun. Items that will be made are:

   		<h1>Collaboration with Ruhi</h1>
    	
    	<p>Being a Banjaara is about exploration - whether it be of a new place or a new skill. It is about having the courage to move out of your comfort zone and wander in the unknown. In the diverse community that occupies Ashoka, this ‘unknown’ can vary: from the lack of knowledge about Haryanvi culture that surrounds us to the lack of a common language that can burst this comfortable bubble. To learn more about our surroundings, from and with the people that occupy it, Banjaara is collaborating with Ruhi to conduct a series of workshops. Ruhi is student-run initiative that aims to equip the support staff with basic oral and written English skills. Our aim of these workshops is to provide a platform of reciprocal learning. Through a shifting of roles, we will be learning from didi’s and bhaiyyas (most of whom primarily hail from in and around Sonipat) about our immediate surroundings. In classic Ashoka style, they get to design the syllabus. For instance, some have already shown interest in showcasing Haryanvi cuisine. In an intimate workshop, we will be cooking local, Haryanvi dishes that are college student time and budget friendly. These will happen in accordance to the didi/bhaiyyas free time either in the pantry or the common rooms. With their consent, we’ll be shooting short videos to make it accessible to the larger Ashokan community.</p>

   		<h1>Interactive Human Library</h1>
    	
    	<p>We aim to create an interactive memory lane where people share their stories in random, intimate one on one interactions. You can borrow a book for 20 minutes and listen to the adventures of your borrowed Banjaara or sign-up to become one! As a listener, there are multiple genres to explore in our library, like ‘Becoming Banjaara’, ‘College Kathas’, ‘Meri Memories’ along with a genre-bending section! </p>
