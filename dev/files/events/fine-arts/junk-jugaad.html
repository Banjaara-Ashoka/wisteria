<div class="brief">
	<h2>Brief</h2>
	<p>We take ‘Trash is Treasure’ literally, to bring to you a one-of-a-kind art event where both your Holmesian and your Picasso-esque sides will have a chance to shine. Teams of five will participate in a treasure hunt, use clues to collect waste around campus, and then use their bounty  to create a piece of artwork - whether a painting, sculpture or installation.<br><br>
	There will be time between clues that will allow participants to plan or create their masterpieces. At the end of the hunt, they will be given an additional 1.5 hours to put it all together to polish their creation for its final submission. This is a test of spontaneity and  artistic ability. The two best submissions will be awarded prizes worth Rs. 15,000 and Rs. 10,000 respectively, and their art installations will be put on display for everyone to see at Banjaara.
