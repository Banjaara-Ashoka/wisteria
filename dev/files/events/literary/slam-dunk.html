<div class="brief">
	<h2>Brief</h2>
	<p>Slam poetry is the form of creative expression that has recently taken the world by storm. With no props, music or costumes, it lets you be you on stage, and express your thoughts in the form of spoken word, regardless of how vulnerable, hilarious or outrageous they are. Slam Dunk is an opportunity for all the poets (and non-poets) to come and woo our judges and audiences with the performance of original poetry - and you never know, you could go back Rs. 12,000 richer.</p>
