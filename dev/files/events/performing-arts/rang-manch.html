	<h2>Brief</h2>
	<p>All the world may be a stage, but here at Banjaara we want you to put up the play of a lifetime. Welcome to the Stage Play competition, where we invite teams to perform scripted plays for the maximum of one hour. Each team will be given the liberty to choose their own genre, theme, stage set-up, and nearly everything else. Their only memo will be to take the audience and judges on a narrative journey worth enough to win a prize of Rs. 40,000. The stakes are high, but there is nothing to lose - cue the drama!</p>
