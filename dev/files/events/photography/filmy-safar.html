	<h2>Brief</h2>
	<p>If words paint pictures, here is your chance to make them a movie! Teams of two can participate in this literary film event to bring to life a pre-assigned poem using Banjaara as their backdrop. These poems capture the longing of freedom and the desire for fun that Banjaara embodies. We want you to capture those themes of the poem while also encapsulating the vibe of the fest itself. It is a filmic challenge of imagination, of working with little to produce something impactful. The winning film will be broadcasted during the festival, and will win itâ€™s creators a prize worth Rs. 10,000.</p>
