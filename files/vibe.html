	Anyone that comes to Banjaara comes as a wanderer, a backpacker, and a traveller. A wanderer - different from a tourist in many aspects - does not have to stick to a specific plan or itinerary; you don’t necessarily have to even participate in any of the events. You can follow our map, visit the People Stops, embrace your inner child at the bouncy castle, strike up a conversation with a stranger, tear up the dance floor in our late-night parties, or just cycle around the entire campus absorbing the vibe.

	Here’s the twist: Banjaara will last for <i>dedh din</i>, just 36 hours. It may sound crazy, difficult, impossible, but it isn’t; we want you to have the most intensive, immersive, fun-filled experience possible, so we want you to push yourself - because we promise you, at the end of the fest, you’ll be begging us for more.

	Taking the best from music festivals, street fairs, melas and haats, we have worked together to bring you an ambience that prides itself on being a “khichdi”. The vibe of the fest is wild, pluralistic and inclusive. So come spend #DedhDin with us, and set out on a quest of creativity, competitive spirit, and collaboration.

	We have no doubt with this spirit of freedom and your abundant talent, magic will happen in Sonepat, on 11th and 12th February, 2017.
