	<h2>Brief</h2>
	<p>Jugaad Innovation is the embodiment of the make-it-happen-somehow attitude that drives up-and-coming entrepreneurs around the world. In this event teams will be given situations or problems that are routinely encountered by Indians living in villages and will then have to create a product to help solve this problem. The materials used, understandably,  should be easily available and affordable by the villagers. After undergoing a two-round elimination, the winning team will secure a prize worth Rs. 10,000. Teams will have to present and explain their product in a video that will be submitted in the preliminary round. Teams that are selected will present their products and have a question and answer session with the judges.</p>
