	<h2>Brief</h2>
	<p>The same way that Banjaara is an amalgamation of the West and the East, we want you to bring together different dance styles to create something new and exciting. The Fusion Dance event allows you to take from various distinct dance forms and put them together so that youâ€™ve created something original altogether. It is a test of grace, creativity and skill - come show us that you know what it takes to make the best of both worlds, and stand the chance to win a prize worth Rs. 30,000.</p>
