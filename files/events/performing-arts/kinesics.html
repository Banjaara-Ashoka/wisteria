<div class="brief">
	<h2>Brief</h2>
	<p>From ballet to kuchipudi, hip-hop to bhangra, dance is storytelling. Movement becomes the language, while the body becomes the medium for story to emerge.<br>
	In this event, we ask teams to come tell us any story, any story, through the medium of dance. We give you the freedom to pick a style(s), costumes, props and music - but all we ask in return is that you move us, make us laugh or cry or scream or suffer. Do this effectively, and you could win a prize worth Rs. 35,000.</p>
