	<h2>Brief</h2>
	<p>We’re going old school hip-hop with this event. Welcome to The Throwdown - Banjaara's street dance-off, where we welcome you to show off your best pops, locks, and swagger for a shot at the grand prize worth Rs. 10,000. Unlike "professional" dance performances, this battle requires your raw talent, improvisational skills, and bucketloads of personality in order for you to woo the crowds and judges. Taking place in two rounds, you will be asked to dance for up to 90 seconds to show off your mad skills.<br>Ready, set, battle!</p>
