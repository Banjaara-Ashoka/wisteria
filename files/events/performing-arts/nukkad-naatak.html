	<h2>Brief</h2>
	<p><i>Suno, suno, bhaiyon aur behno!</i> Banjaara announces its Street Play competition, for one and all.<br>Street theatre is integral to Indian culture. Since time immemorial, weâ€™ve had motley crowds of people gathered around street performers at the street corner. Today, we invite teams to come put up nukkad naataks to a large and diverse audience, to make their voices heard and to shine as actors. We want teams to use this classic performative art form and most effectively combine entertainment with education and social awareness. The winners of this competition will receive a prize worth Rs. 40,000.</p>
