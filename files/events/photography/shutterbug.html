	<h2>Brief</h2>
	<p>Shutterbug is a shoutout to all photographers who pride themselves on their ability to capture stories behind moments. All you have to do is capture the following themes in your photographs: things you see while travelling, capturing motion, one thing that you love about Ashoka University, and emotions. Subsequently, you have to submit one photograph for each theme, with respective captions to elucidate your creative depiction.<br><br>The catch is this: you only have 24 hours from the word go. Going the extra mile will be worth it, though, because the winner of this competition will receive a prize worth Rs. 10,000. Prove your salt as a photographer - capture the essence of Banjaara and win big!</p>
